             <h1>HELL</h1>

<p>In religion and folklore, Hell is an afterlife location in which evil souls are subjected to punitive suffering,
 often torture as eternal punishment after death. Religions with a linear divine history often depict hells as eternal destinations,
 the biggest examples of which are Christianity and Islam, whereas religions with reincarnation usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between incarnations,
 as is the case in the dharmic religions. </p>

<br>

<p>Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under Earth's surface.
 Other afterlife destinations include Heaven, Paradise, Purgatory, Limbo, and the underworld.</p>
