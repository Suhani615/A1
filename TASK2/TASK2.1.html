         <h1> Heaven  </h1>
<br>
 <p>HEAVEN is a common religious cosmological, or transcendent supernatural place where beings such as gods, angels,
 spirits, saints, or venerated ancestors are said to originate, be enthroned, or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, 
heavenly beings can descend to Earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter Heaven alive.</p>

<br>

<p>Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the holiest place, a Paradise,
 in contrast to hell or the Underworld or the "low places", 
and universally or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of divinity, goodness, piety, faith,
 or other virtues or right beliefs or simply the will of God. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a world to come.</p>
